                <p className="p-graph">I earn a living by creating custom brands and logo designs from scratch,
                     as well as designing and building high quality websites and blogs,
                     but I also enjoy producing the odd t-shirt graphic,
                     illustration or character design. I pride myself in having the nerdy skills to build top notch creations online,
                     as well as being knowledgeable in the print side of design</p>
